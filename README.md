# HyMM
HyMM: Hybrid method for disease-gene prediction by integrating multiscale module structures


## Requirements
Matlab 2016 or above   


## Codes 
A_DGP_HyMM_ByRank.m: the recommended HyMM algorithms in the study. <br>
main_HyMM.m: cross-validation code.  <br>


## Dataset
A demo dataset is located in the directory: data/demoDataSet&PPICOM_ModCM_delta=0.2.mat<br>
This dataset includes: <br>
(1) disease-gene associations, disease-disease associations and gene-gene associations;  <br>
(2) multiscale module partition matrices. <br>


## Results 
The results will be autamatically saved into the directory: results.

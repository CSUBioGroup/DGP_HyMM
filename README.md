# HyMM
HyMM: Hybrid method for disease-gene prediction by integrating multiscale module structures


## Requirements

Matlab 2016 or above   


## Codes<br> 
A_DGP_HyMM_ByRank.m: the recommended HyMM algorithms in the study. 
main_HyMM.m: cross-validation code.  


## Dataset<br>
A demo dataset is located in the directory: data/demoDataSet&PPICOM_ModCM_delta=0.2.mat
This dataset includes: 
(1) disease-gene associations, disease-disease associations and gene-gene associations;  
(2) multiscale module partition matrices. 


## Results<br>
The results will be autamatically saved into the directory: results.
